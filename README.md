# Erastosthenes Toy Project 

This reposotory will have all the required files and docs for a small toy project that computes primes numbers.

We will be exploring the following:

1. Unit tests: the fundamental building block functions
2. Integration tests: how our fundamental building block functions are playing with each other as we expect
3. Regression tests: tests to see if there is any 'drift' in the function output--is it starting to diverge with what we had before?
