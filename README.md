# Erastosthenes Toy Project 

This reposotory will have all the required files and docs for a small toy project that computes primes numbers.

We will be exploring the following:

1. Unit tests: the fundamental building block functions (sieve_slow and sieve_fast are our building blocks)
   If not integer, return error (edge case)
   If 2, return 2 (edge case)
   If 1 return [] (edge case)
   If 10, return [2, 3, 5, 7] (interior case)
3. Integration tests: how our fundamental building block functions are playing with each other as we expect
4. Regression tests: tests to see if there is any 'drift' in the function output--is it starting to diverge with what we had before?
